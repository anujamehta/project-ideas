## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Better WhenIsGood

This project will be to create a website or application to deliver an improved meeting planning service that can take in a group's Google or Apple calendars and determine some possible meeting times that work for everyone. WhenIsGood is a similar service, but has its shortcomings: users have to individually bubble in their availability, admins have to keep track of several links in order to update or view the calendar, and there is no export feature built in. Microsoft teams has a scheduling assistant that can check every team members Outlook calendar to find a common meeting time, but this is limited to users of Microsoft Teams and cannot be extended informal meeting arrangements.

The project will combine the scheduling assistant from Microsoft teams with platform compatibility so both Apple and Google Calendar users can import their calendars. This project could go in a couple different directions: either as a stand alone web app that can import the data, or as a chrome extension that runs with the Google/Apple/Microsoft calendar sites. These can be built using JavaScript/React.
